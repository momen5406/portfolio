        I’m a front-end developer who crafts clean, responsive, and user-focused
        web applications. My specialty lies in turning designs into
        pixel-perfect, high-performance interfaces using React, Next.js, and
        Tailwind CSS. I care about speed, accessibility, and detail — because a
        great user experience is as much about how a site feels as how it looks.
        Currently, I’m seeking opportunities to join a team where I can
        contribute to building polished, scalable products.

        When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring design trends and learning about
        new web technologies.
